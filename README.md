Project 7: Automation and Version Control with Git, Linux, and PowerShell in Azure
Objective: Automate Azure resource management tasks using PowerShell scripting on Linux and maintain version control of scripts using Git and GitHub.

Solution Steps: 

Setup Azure Environment: Create an Azure subscription if you don't have one already. Provision a Linux-based virtual machine (VM) in Azure for executing PowerShell scripts. 

Install Git and PowerShell on Linux VM: SSH into the Linux VM and install Git and PowerShell Core. Git will be used for version control, while PowerShell Core will be used for scripting Azure automation tasks.

Clone GitHub Repository: Clone a Git repository from GitHub containing sample PowerShell scripts for Azure automation tasks. This repository will serve as your project repository for version control.

Explore Linux Fundamentals: Familiarize yourself with Linux fundamentals and commands for navigating the file system, managing permissions, and executing shell commands.

Study PowerShell Scripting: Learn PowerShell scripting basics, including cmdlets for interacting with Azure resources via Azure PowerShell module, handling variables, loops, and conditional statements. 

Create PowerShell Scripts: Write PowerShell scripts to automate common Azure tasks such as provisioning virtual machines, managing storage accounts, configuring network settings, and deploying web applications.

Test PowerShell Scripts: Test the PowerShell scripts on the Linux VM to ensure they perform the intended automation tasks correctly. Use Azure PowerShell module cmdlets to interact with Azure resources programmatically.

Version Control with Git: Add your PowerShell scripts to the Git repository on the Linux VM. Commit changes to the repository and push them to GitHub to maintain version history and collaborate with team members. 

Implement Continuous Integration (CI): Set up a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions or Azure Pipelines to automatically trigger script validation and testing whenever changes are pushed to the GitHub repository.

Execute Automation Tasks: Use scheduled Azure Automation Runbooks or Azure Functions to execute PowerShell scripts on a predefined schedule or in response to specific events, such as resource provisioning or configuration changes.

Monitor and Manage Automation Tasks: Monitor the execution of automation tasks using Azure Monitor and log analytics. Set up alerts for detecting failures or anomalies in script execution and take remedial actions as needed.

Documentation and Presentation: Document the PowerShell scripting process, Linux commands used, automation tasks implemented, and version control practices followed. Prepare a report summarizing the benefits of using Git, Linux, and PowerShell for Azure automation and version control.
